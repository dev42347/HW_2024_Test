**Gameplay:**
The player controls Doofus, a white square, using the keyboard arrow keys (or WASD keys) to move around the screen. Pulpits (green squares) spawn at random locations, and the player must avoid getting stuck in an area without pulpits.

The pulpits disappear after a certain time, and new pulpits spawn. The player must survive and score points by staying on the pulpits. If Doofus is left without a pulpit to stand on, the game is over.

The game consists of three levels, each with increasing difficulty. The score does not exceed 7 to progress to the next level.
